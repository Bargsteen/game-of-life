# Game of Life in Purescript

In honor of recently deceased mathematician [John Horton Conway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Horton_Conway), I decided to
implement his [Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) in [PureScript](https://www.purescript.org/).

It runs in the terminal, but it should be quite easy to add a web-based
interface to it, which could also allow for easier creation of new games.

Here is an example of the
[Pentadecathlon](https://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/Pentadecathlon), which repeats
after 15 steps.
